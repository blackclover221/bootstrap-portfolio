# bootstrap-portfolio
This is my portfolio using bootstrap
 - the sbout me section highlights the skills I have developed and learned/ expect to learn in this bootcamp.
 - project section showcases some of my completed/ ongoing projects which I have completed suring the class and my own time 
 - the contact me section shows where I can be reached/ e.g. email, linkedin and Twitter.


# what went well: 

* Understanding how to use bootstrap and learning how to make my portfolio have the simple and clean aesthetic I desired for it to have with my favourite colours. 

* manipulating and trying to figure out how sizes work by increasing and reducing the pixles.

* adding an actual GIF to my portfolio which I initially didn not know was possible. This is great as it will allow me to continue to develop my skillset when it comes to UX/UI as well as allow me to be distingushed developer. 


# What was challenging to me

* Trying to figure out how to do a more descriptive and "cooler footer" if I am being honest, I did not think I did a great job at it and it took me a while to get a hang of it. 

* adding the links to some of work as for some reason it is now showing the deployed links so I removed them and left them as empty for now
